# Concourse Dynamic Pipline Test

Goals:

- Create a pipeline and job responsible for scaffolding other pipelines
- Keep a primary, persistent pipeline for master branch
- Create PR and release pipeslines
  - pipes for branches instead of PRs?
- Use pipeline configurations from this repository
- Update pipelines each time this repository changes
